SparrowMod
=========

SparrowMod based on CanaryMod by CanaryModTeam.
This is a Minecraft Server wrapper and library with built-in data  
management features as well as player permissions and groups management.  
SparrowMod provides a stable and feature-rich framework that makes sure that  
Plugins written today, will still work in months without the need of updating  
on each Minecraft update. As server owner, this allows you to spend more time  
on managing your server, making it awesome, instead of waiting for all your  
plugins to update each time.  

As a Plugin Developer, our Mod allows you to concentrate on the things that make  
your Plugin great and unique - you won’t ever need to bother about implementing  
data storage or resolving dependencies with other plugins. We do the dirty work  
for you, you go and make amazing plugins. It’s as easy as that!  

This repository contains the wrapper/mod implementation.

Differences (CanaryMod --> SparrowMod)
======================================
1. Quick upgrade to the new version Minecraft.
2. Implementation support Forge (in development).
3. The harsh Russian code optimization. >:о
4. Full support CanaryMod Plugins.

Pull Requests
=============

It helps us when others take the time to submit fixes rather than just pointing out bugs/inconsistancies.  
However, We have standards for the sources we have. Things like formatting  
and generally following the [Sun/Oracle coding standards](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html)
